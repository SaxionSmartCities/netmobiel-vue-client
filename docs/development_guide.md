# Development guide

Issues are registered in Jira (https://saxionsmartcities.atlassian.net/).

A feature that needs to be implemented needs to be associated to an issue in Jira.
If no issue is present please create one.
When picking up an issue retrieve the issue number from Jira (for example NBL-123).
Create a branch with this issue number as name (for exampl create a branch "NBL-123")
Implement the required functionality on this branch. When finished create a pull
request for a merge with "dev". After the branch has been merged it will be deleted.
